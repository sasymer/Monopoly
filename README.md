# Monopoly

To play, open Game.java and run.

Created a computer version of the game Monopoly with a partner, using Java.
My portion includes 1500+ lines of code.

I largely handled the back-end and algorithmic aspects of the game, while my partner focused on 
creating and updating the display. 

The game includes options to play with 1-4 players. If you choose to play with 1 player, the 
other player will be an AI computer player that I implemented.

Our version of Monopoly is complete with all the properties, cards, and functionality of the original game,
including purchasing and selling properties, bidding for properties, and mortaging. 
The display side panel updates each player's money and properties throughout the game, and the 
player icon's location is updated each turn.
